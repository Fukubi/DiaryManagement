### Necessary Third Party Software

- CMake

### Compilation Instructions

It's recommended to create a build folder in this project tree to compile it

With a build folder you can use 

```
cmake ..
make
```  

and if you didn't created a build folder you can use

```
cmake .
make
```

Either way you will have a executable file.

### Why CMake?

CMake is used to create a easier build system that is cross-platform and easy to use, that way you can compile it easily and in almost any OS.
